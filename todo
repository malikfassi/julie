Add a tag/catgeory for each activity

You have to search the web for each activity, accomodations, transfers, etc ... for an estimation of the cost. 

Make sure the price estimation is correct for every price.
Make sure to include de price of everything when doing total cost. 
The recap per city is relevant but the key numbers you chose are irrelevant. 



Make the journey customizable by the user (order of cities, activities, transportation, accomodations, restaurants)
Create a list of activities to choose from, extend it as much as possible
based on the customization of the user, dynamically update days per cities, and total cost. 
For now the list of existing cities is static
add links for booking accommodations, transfers, museums, restaurants.
